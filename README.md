## Game Rules:  
* The purpose of this card game is to score 31 points, and or not to score the lowest number of points.  
* All number cards are worth their number value, All picture cards are worth 10 points, except Aces, which are worth 11 points.  
* You need to collect three cards from the same suite (heart, club, spade, diamond) to be able to collect 31, consisting of 1 ace and two 10 point cards.  
* You can collect three different suite cards with the same rank which will give you a score of 30.5 (3 aces counts as 30.5 and not 33).  
* If the bank (3 open cards the middle) has a good hand, you can swap your hand with the bank. This will action will by default end your turn and force you too fold/hold in the game. Use wisely!  
* The first player (local player) has the option to swap all cards with the bank without having to fold/hold, only at its first turn. Swapping cards with the bank after the first turn will default back to the origional rule.  
* If one player scores 31, all other players will get one last turn. (A badge displaying 31 will appear)  
* If all other players fold/hold then the the last player will get one last turn. (A player who folds/hold will display a red stroke around the cards)  
* An orange stroke will appear around the cards of the auto-player who's turn it is.
* Each turn you can change ONE card in your hand with ONE card in the bank.
* You can select and deselect cards as many times as you like by clicking. But only with ONE bank card and ONE hand card selected, will the Hold button change into a Play Cards button and finalize the action of changing cards and end your turn.
